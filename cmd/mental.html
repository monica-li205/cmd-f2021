    Deliberately taking a break from social media, e-mail, blogging, and so on can help us recharge and gives our brain the downtime it needs to work at an optimal level. Digital fatigue can lead to lack of energy, mental clarity, burnout and can cause negative psychological and physical effects to our overall well-beingâ€”let alone work output. The constant stimulus of notifications can cause anxiety and can lead to mental exhaustion.
    </p>
    <p>
        To combat this, set a dedicated time for screen-time. Especially during the pandemic, when many of us work on our computers in isolation, the line has blurred between work and weekend. Schedule breaks in your day to allow your mind to rest and defend this time valiantly.
    </p>
    <p> Additionally, take stock of the apps on your phone. An overabundance of apps can result in notification overload. Limiting notifications can reduce interruptions throughout your day and reduces your reliance on yet another screen during this screen-filled time.
