<div class="hide"><p>Exercize has been linked to decresing symptoms of depression and getting outside has been proven to have benefits on your brain! Women are twice as likely to experience anxiety disorders as men. About five minutes of aerobic exercises, like running, have been found to stimulate anti-anxiety effects. Dancing can lead to improved mood and body image. For those looking for an indoor and low-impact option, research on yoga has suggested the practice improves general wellness and improves mental and emotional health. Meditation has benefits of relieving stress and boosting compassion!</h3>

		<div class="mental">When was the last time you ate?</div>
<div class="hide"><p>Felice Jacka, the President of the International Society for Nutritional Psychiatry Research, was quoted saying that A very large body of evidence now exists that suggests diet is as important to mental health as it is to physical health." Foods rich in Omega-3 fatty acids are mood improvers and dark leafy greens are known brain protectives. A psychological study suggested that regularly eating seven portions of fruit and vegetables may improve happiness.
    Research has suggested that boiling, steaming, poaching, broiling, grilling, sauteeing, and even microwaving are some of the healthiest ways to cook foods to preserve their nutrients!</p></div>

    Deliberately taking a break from social media, e-mail, blogging, and so on can help us recharge and gives our brain the downtime it needs to work at an optimal level. Digital fatigue can lead to lack of energy, mental clarity, burnout and can cause negative psychological and physical effects to our overall well-beingâ€”let alone work output. The constant stimulus of notifications can cause anxiety and can lead to mental exhaustion.
    </p>
    <p>
        To combat this, set a dedicated time for screen-time. Especially during the pandemic, when many of us work on our computers in isolation, the line has blurred between work and weekend. Schedule breaks in your day to allow your mind to rest and defend this time valiantly.
    </p>
    <p> Additionally, take stock of the apps on your phone. An overabundance of apps can result in notification overload. Limiting notifications can reduce interruptions throughout your day and reduces your reliance on yet another screen during this screen-filled time.
